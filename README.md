# Train Seat Booking System

## Problem Statement

The train seat booking system is designed for a single coach train with the following configuration:

- The coach contains **80 seats**, arranged in **7 seats per row**, with the **last row containing 3 seats**.
- A person can reserve up to **7 seats at a time**.
- **Priority:**
  - Seats should be booked in the **same row** whenever possible.
  - If seats are not available in the same row, the system will book **nearby seats**.

The seating status is represented by a string of length 80, where:

- `0` indicates an **empty seat**.
- `1` indicates a **booked seat**.

The system ensures the seating status is **persistent** by storing this string in a database. This allows the program to maintain the latest seat status across different sessions.

## Features

- **Seat Availability Check:**
  - Determines if a row has enough consecutive empty seats for a booking.
- **Reservation Logic:**
  - Books seats in a single row if possible.
  - Ensures nearby seats are booked when a single-row reservation isn't feasible.
- **Database Integration:**
  - The seat status is stored in a database for persistence.
  - The application fetches and updates the seat status dynamically.
